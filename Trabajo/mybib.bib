abstract = {The authors investigate the thermal insulation of plasmas in Tokamak-3, taking as thermal insulation parameter the energy confinement time ofthe plasma $\tau$E and relating it to the discharge parameters: the stabilizing magnetic field Hz, the charged particle density ne and the discharge current I. It is found that for ne ≥ 2 × l013 cm−3 $\tau$E is virtually independent of Hz, for ne = (l-5) × 1013 cm−3 $\tau$E increases somewhat with ne and in proportion to I. The experimental results fit the empirical formula $\tau$E∼a2H$\phi$.},

@article{Oliphant1934,
abstract = {In our paper “Transmutation of Elements by Protons,”* we showed that the transformation of some of the light elements by protons could be conveniently studied by the use of comparatively low voltages—of the order of 100,000 volts—by generating an intense narrow beam of protons which fell on the target of small area of about 1 sq. cm. In the light of experience of the past year, the installation has been modified in several particulars and entirely reconstructed. By the addition of another 100,000-volt transformer in tandem and the use of appropriate condensers the D. C. voltage available has been raised from 200,000 to 400,000 volts. The main change, however, consists in the use of a horizontal instead of a vertical discharge tube. In place of glass, a corrugated porcelain wall bushing capable of withstanding high voltages has been used to insulate the positive electrode, while the earthed metal casing forming the negative electrode projects through a brick wall. The arrangement of the internal electrodes is, in general, similar to that used in the earlier apparatus. The oil cooling circulation has been improved as the electrodes cannot, now be cooled by radiation alone. As before a magnetic field is applied to sort out the various types of ions generated in the discharge tube. The use of the horizontal tube has many advantages, not only for assembling the controls at convenient points but also in the ease of handling the counting apparatus and absorbing screens. The new installation has worked smoothly and satisfactorily and we have been able to increase the number of disintegration particles available for study by a factor of 10 to 50. The thick brick wall acts as a complete screen for the X-radiation generated in the system.},

Two classes of reactor are considered: first, self-sustaining systems in which the charged reaction products are trapped and, secondly, pulsed systems in which all the reaction products escape so that energy must be supplied continuously during the pulse. It is found that not only must the temperature be sufficiently high, but also the reaction must be sustained long enough for a definite fraction of the fuel to be burnt.},

Regarding microinstabilities, it is shown that the ordinary, collisionless trapped-electron mode is stable in large parts of parameter space in stellarators that have been designed so that the parallel adiabatic invariant decreases with radius. Also, the first global, electromagnetic, gyrokinetic stability calculations performed for Wendelstein 7-X suggest that kinetic ballooning modes are more stable than in a typical tokamak.},

@article{doi:10.1063/1.4921255,
abstract = {Toroidal symmetry is an important concept for plasma confinement; it allows the existence of nested flux surface MHD equilibria and conserved invariants for particle motion. However, perfect symmetry is unachievable in realistic toroidal plasma devices. For example, tokamaks have toroidal ripple due to discrete field coils, optimized stellarators do not achieve exact quasi-symmetry, the plasma itself continually seeks lower energy states through helical 3D deformations, and reactors will likely have non-uniform distributions of ferritic steel near the plasma. Also, some level of designed-in 3D magnetic field structure is now anticipated for most concepts in order to provide the plasma control needed for a stable, steady-state fusion reactor. Such planned 3D field structures can take many forms, ranging from tokamaks with weak 3D edge localized mode suppression fields to stellarators with more dominant 3D field structures. This motivates the development of physics models that are applicable across the full range of 3D devices. Ultimately, the questions of how much symmetry breaking can be tolerated and how to optimize its design must be addressed for all fusion concepts. A closely coupled program of simulation, experimental validation, and design optimization is required to determine what forms and amplitudes of 3D shaping and symmetry breaking will be compatible with the requirements of future fusion reactors.},
