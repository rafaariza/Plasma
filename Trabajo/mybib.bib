@article{Oliphant1934,
abstract = {In our paper “Transmutation of Elements by Protons,”* we showed that the transformation of some of the light elements by protons could be conveniently studied by the use of comparatively low voltages—of the order of 100,000 volts—by generating an intense narrow beam of protons which fell on the target of small area of about 1 sq. cm. In the light of experience of the past year, the installation has been modified in several particulars and entirely reconstructed. By the addition of another 100,000-volt transformer in tandem and the use of appropriate condensers the D. C. voltage available has been raised from 200,000 to 400,000 volts. The main change, however, consists in the use of a horizontal instead of a vertical discharge tube. In place of glass, a corrugated porcelain wall bushing capable of withstanding high voltages has been used to insulate the positive electrode, while the earthed metal casing forming the negative electrode projects through a brick wall. The arrangement of the internal electrodes is, in general, similar to that used in the earlier apparatus. The oil cooling circulation has been improved as the electrodes cannot, now be cooled by radiation alone. As before a magnetic field is applied to sort out the various types of ions generated in the discharge tube. The use of the horizontal tube has many advantages, not only for assembling the controls at convenient points but also in the ease of handling the counting apparatus and absorbing screens. The new installation has worked smoothly and satisfactorily and we have been able to increase the number of disintegration particles available for study by a factor of 10 to 50. The thick brick wall acts as a complete screen for the X-radiation generated in the system.},

@article{doi:10.1063/1.4921255,
abstract = {Toroidal symmetry is an important concept for plasma confinement; it allows the existence of nested flux surface MHD equilibria and conserved invariants for particle motion. However, perfect symmetry is unachievable in realistic toroidal plasma devices. For example, tokamaks have toroidal ripple due to discrete field coils, optimized stellarators do not achieve exact quasi-symmetry, the plasma itself continually seeks lower energy states through helical 3D deformations, and reactors will likely have non-uniform distributions of ferritic steel near the plasma. Also, some level of designed-in 3D magnetic field structure is now anticipated for most concepts in order to provide the plasma control needed for a stable, steady-state fusion reactor. Such planned 3D field structures can take many forms, ranging from tokamaks with weak 3D edge localized mode suppression fields to stellarators with more dominant 3D field structures. This motivates the development of physics models that are applicable across the full range of 3D devices. Ultimately, the questions of how much symmetry breaking can be tolerated and how to optimize its design must be addressed for all fusion concepts. A closely coupled program of simulation, experimental validation, and design optimization is required to determine what forms and amplitudes of 3D shaping and symmetry breaking will be compatible with the requirements of future fusion reactors.},

abstract = {Full suppression of neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) using electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) should be reached before mode locking (stop of rotation) makes suppression impossible. For an ITER scenario 2 plasma, the similar time scales for locking and island growth necessitate the combined modelling of the growth of the mode and its slow down due to wall induced drag. Using such a model, the maximum allowed latency between the seeding of the mode and the start of ECCD deposition and maximum deviation in the radial position are determined. The maximum allowed latency is determined for two limiting models for island growth; the polarization model with wmarg = 2 cm, representing the worst case, and the transport model with wmarg = 6 cm, representing the best case. NTMs with seed island widths up to 9.5 cm and 12 cm for the 2/1 and the 3/2 NTM, respectively, are suppressible. The maximum allowed latency is 1.05 s and 2.95 s for the 2/1 and 3/2 NTM, respectively, for the worst case model. Radial misalignment should not exceed 7–10 mm for the 2/1 NTM and 5–16 mm for the 3/2 NTM depending on the model for island growth. As long as the alignment suffices, it does not reduce the maximum allowed latency. Mode locking has serious implications for any real-time NTM control system on ITER that aims to suppress NTMs by ECCD.},

The density window was extended up to the density limit towards which the power threshold exhibits a dramatic increase. First results with the new divertor are compared to the previous threshold scaling. Local edge measurements at the L-H transition show that the temperature decreases slightly with density and increases with magnetic field, and that the ion collisionality at the plasma edge is always clearly above unity, between 5 and 15. Experiments at high power threshold exhibit improved L-mode confinement and suggest that two mechanisms are required for the L-H transition.},

abstract = {The paper presents a theoretical model of the H-mode in tokamaks which is based on the bifurcation of the radial electric field at the plasma edge. The electric field is determined by the balance of the non-ambipolar fluxes of ions and electrons at the edge. It is found that bifurcations of the radial electric field, the particle flux and the convective energy loss occur when the edge gradient reaches a critical value. This is attributed to L-H or H-L transition. The critical conditions are examined and the role of neutral particles as well as the effect of impurities are incorporated in the model. Combining the confinement scaling laws for both the core plasma and the scrape-off layer plasma, the threshold power for the transition is derived. The temporal evolution associated with the transition is studied.},

abstract = {The structure of the radial electric field and heat transport at the magnetic island in the large helical device (LHD) are investigated by measuring the radial profile of the poloidal flow with charge exchange spectroscopy and measuring the time evolution of the electron temperature with ECE. A vortex-like plasma flow along the magnetic flux surface inside the magnetic island is observed when the n/m = 1/1 external perturbation field becomes large enough to increase the magnetic island width above a critical range (15–20{\%} of minor radius) in LHD. This convective poloidal flow results in a non-flat space potential inside the magnetic island. The sign of the curvature of the space potential (∂2$\Phi$/∂r2, where $\Phi$ is the space potential) depends on the radial electric field at the boundary of the magnetic island. The heat transport inside the magnetic island is studied with a cold pulse propagation technique. The experimental results show the existence of radial electric field shear at the boundary of the magnetic island and a reduction in heat transport at the boundary and inside the magnetic island.},

Theoretical approaches to describing a turbulent plasma transport in a tokamak are outlined and phenomenology of major energy confinement regimes observed in tokamaks, including those with edge and internal transport barriers, is described. The chapter is focused on the energy confinement in the high confinement regime (H-mode) with the edge localized MHD modes, the basic operational regime of ITER. Three approaches are being pursued: (i) derivation of empirical global scaling laws; (ii) non-dimensionally similar studies; and (iii) one dimensional transport modelling codes, with the first approach recommended as the most robust at the present time. Special attention is paid to analysis of uncertainties in confinement predictions. Empirical scaling relations for projecting the L-mode to H-mode power threshold based on regression analysis of an extensive database are discussed. Particle and toroidal momentum confinement and their relation to energy confinement are reviewed.},

Enhancement of core electron heat confinement is observed when the rational surface is placed in the vicinity of the power deposition zone, either by performing a magnetic configuration scan or by inducing Ohmic current in a single discharge. The key to improving heat confinement seems to be a locally strong positive radial electric field, which is made possible by a synergistic effect between enhanced electron heat fluxes through radial positions around low-order rationals and pump out mechanisms in the heat deposition zone.},

The positive radial electric field increases by a factor of 3 in the central plasma region when an e-ITB forms. The experiments reported demonstrate that the formation of an e-ITB depends on the magnetic configuration. Calculations of the modification of the rotational transform due to plasma current lead to the interpretation that the formation of an e-ITB can be triggered by positioning a low order rational surface close to the plasma core region. In configurations without any central low order rational, no barrier is formed for any accessible value of heating power. Different mechanisms associated with neoclassical/turbulent bifurcations and kinetic effects are put forward to explain the impact of magnetic topology on radial electric fields and confinement.},

abstract = {Interpretative transport has been used to revisit the global scalings of TJ-II plasmas with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECH), from a local perspective. Density, rotational transform and ECH power scans were analysed based mainly upon Thomson scattering data (electron density and temperature) in steady state discharges. The thermal diffusivity $\chi$e is estimated assuming pure diffusion and negligible convective heat fluxes in a set of 201 discharges. The density scan indicates that for normalized minor radii $\rho$ ≲ 0.4 there is no significant change of $\chi$e with density in the range studied 
, while in the density gradient region, $\chi$e decreases with line density. In the rotational transform scan, there is an overall tendency of $\chi$e to decrease with increasing rotational transform, but we also find that the presence of a low order rational value of the rotational transform is accompanied by a local lowering of $\chi$e. Finally, in the ECH power scan, $\chi$e is found to have an overall increment in 0.2 {\textless} $\rho$ {\textless} 0.6 when QECH increases from 200 to 400 kW, although it is less significant in the density gradient region.},

abstract = {Electron energy transport in the Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator exhibits a strong sensitivity to the boundary value of the rotational transform when the magnetic shear is low. Pronounced confinement maxima close to the low order rational values correlate with a low density of other rational numbers in these favourable ranges. The dependence is lost if magnetic shear is increased by large plasma currents. The hypothesis is proposed that, at rational flux surfaces, electron energy transport is increased above the already anomalous level and that magnetic shear reduces the additional enhancement. An empirical model that incorporates these features into a simple expression for the electron heat conductivity can reproduce the experimental dependences over a wide range of external control parameters, e.g. the rotational transform and the net plasma current. Except for the explicit shear dependence, this model bears a remarkable similarity to the RTP model, which successfully describes the electron transport barriers near low order rational q surfaces in RTP and other tokamaks.},

The shear of the negative radial electric field increases at the L–H transition by an amount that depends on the magnetic configuration and heating power.
