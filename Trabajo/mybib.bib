It is found that for ne ≥ 2 × l013 cm−3 $\tau$E is virtually independent of Hz, for ne = (l-5) × 1013 cm−3 $\tau$E increases somewhat with ne and in proportion to I. The experimental results fit the empirical formula $\tau$E∼a2H$\phi$.},

@article{Oliphant1934,
abstract = {In our paper “Transmutation of Elements by Protons,”* we showed that the transformation of some of the light elements by protons could be conveniently studied by the use of comparatively low voltages—of the order of 100,000 volts—by generating an intense narrow beam of protons which fell on the target of small area of about 1 sq. cm. In the light of experience of the past year, the installation has been modified in several particulars and entirely reconstructed. By the addition of another 100,000-volt transformer in tandem and the use of appropriate condensers the D. C. voltage available has been raised from 200,000 to 400,000 volts. The main change, however, consists in the use of a horizontal instead of a vertical discharge tube. In place of glass, a corrugated porcelain wall bushing capable of withstanding high voltages has been used to insulate the positive electrode, while the earthed metal casing forming the negative electrode projects through a brick wall. The arrangement of the internal electrodes is, in general, similar to that used in the earlier apparatus. The oil cooling circulation has been improved as the electrodes cannot, now be cooled by radiation alone. As before a magnetic field is applied to sort out the various types of ions generated in the discharge tube. The use of the horizontal tube has many advantages, not only for assembling the controls at convenient points but also in the ease of handling the counting apparatus and absorbing screens. The new installation has worked smoothly and satisfactorily and we have been able to increase the number of disintegration particles available for study by a factor of 10 to 50. The thick brick wall acts as a complete screen for the X-radiation generated in the system.},

@article{doi:10.1063/1.4921255,
abstract = {Toroidal symmetry is an important concept for plasma confinement; it allows the existence of nested flux surface MHD equilibria and conserved invariants for particle motion. However, perfect symmetry is unachievable in realistic toroidal plasma devices. For example, tokamaks have toroidal ripple due to discrete field coils, optimized stellarators do not achieve exact quasi-symmetry, the plasma itself continually seeks lower energy states through helical 3D deformations, and reactors will likely have non-uniform distributions of ferritic steel near the plasma. Also, some level of designed-in 3D magnetic field structure is now anticipated for most concepts in order to provide the plasma control needed for a stable, steady-state fusion reactor. Such planned 3D field structures can take many forms, ranging from tokamaks with weak 3D edge localized mode suppression fields to stellarators with more dominant 3D field structures. This motivates the development of physics models that are applicable across the full range of 3D devices. Ultimately, the questions of how much symmetry breaking can be tolerated and how to optimize its design must be addressed for all fusion concepts. A closely coupled program of simulation, experimental validation, and design optimization is required to determine what forms and amplitudes of 3D shaping and symmetry breaking will be compatible with the requirements of future fusion reactors.},

abstract = {Full suppression of neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) using electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) should be reached before mode locking (stop of rotation) makes suppression impossible. For an ITER scenario 2 plasma, the similar time scales for locking and island growth necessitate the combined modelling of the growth of the mode and its slow down due to wall induced drag. Using such a model, the maximum allowed latency between the seeding of the mode and the start of ECCD deposition and maximum deviation in the radial position are determined. The maximum allowed latency is determined for two limiting models for island growth; the polarization model with wmarg = 2 cm, representing the worst case, and the transport model with wmarg = 6 cm, representing the best case. NTMs with seed island widths up to 9.5 cm and 12 cm for the 2/1 and the 3/2 NTM, respectively, are suppressible. The maximum allowed latency is 1.05 s and 2.95 s for the 2/1 and 3/2 NTM, respectively, for the worst case model. Radial misalignment should not exceed 7–10 mm for the 2/1 NTM and 5–16 mm for the 3/2 NTM depending on the model for island growth. As long as the alignment suffices, it does not reduce the maximum allowed latency. Mode locking has serious implications for any real-time NTM control system on ITER that aims to suppress NTMs by ECCD.},
